# Chuck Norris Jokes App

Chuck Norris Jokes App is a simple Flutter application that fetches Chuck Norris jokes from an API and allows users to browse through random jokes. Users can also like jokes, and liked jokes are stored in a separate screen.

## Features

- **Random Jokes:** Fetch Chuck Norris jokes from an external API and display them in a user-friendly format.

- **Like Jokes:** Users can like their favorite jokes, and liked jokes are stored for later viewing.

- **Local Database:** Liked jokes are now stored locally using a database. This ensures that liked jokes persist even if the app is closed and reopened.

- **Social Media Sharing:** Share your favorite Chuck Norris jokes on various social media platforms directly from the app.

- **Navigation Drawer:** A navigation drawer provides easy access to different sections of the app, including Liked Jokes.
